The simulation is capable to run on VM's such as VirtualBOX. I used nano to save the files on my VM and ran them through the console with python3 and nano comands.
Picked up on a lot of functionalities in VM's.
Mainly used libraries for simulation such as nest and libraries for plotting and graphing the spikes of neurons with matplotlib. I also used DLR Visualization LIBRARY 2 in some visualizations.
The outputs of the spikes that are recorded by the spike recorder depend on the inputs such as simulation time, number of neurons, weight of the dependencies, and the input signal frequency hz generated by the Poisson generator.
