The simulation is capable of running on VMs such as VirtualBox.  

I used Nano to save the files on my VM and ran them through the console with Python 3 and Nano commands. 

I picked up a lot of functionalities in VMs. I mainly used libraries for simulation,
such as NEST, and libraries for plotting and graphing neuron spikes with Matplotlib. 

I also used DLR Visualization Library 2 for some visualizations. 

The outputs of the spikes that are recorded by the spike recorder depend on the inputs,
such as simulation time, number of neurons, weight of the dependencies, and the input signal frequency (Hz) generated by the Poisson generator.
